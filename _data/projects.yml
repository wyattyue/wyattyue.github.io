  description: >
    Many metabolic enzymes performing essential cellular roles do not exist as individual entities, but instead function as homo-oligomeric assemblies, or in concert with other partner proteins in the cellular compartment. 
    We have vested interest in studying these macromolecular enzyme complexes that are linked with genetic diseases. 
    We adopt recombinant co-expression and endogenous isolation strategies for structural, biochemical and biophysical studies aimed at characterizing the functional and disease-causing mechanisms.

    We combine x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and complementary biophysical methods to study enzyme structures, dynamics and interactions. 
    We have to date determined > 200 structures.

  description: >
    Disease-associated metabolic enzymes often lead to aberrant flux and accumulation of toxic metabolites. 
    Therefore, pathway manipulation to reduce flux to the defective enzyme could have therapeutic benefit, as shown for lysosomal storage disorders. 
    Our objectives are to develop small molecule inhibitors for enzymes upstream of a metabolic defect, as 'substrate reduction therapy'.
