  name: ENZYME ASSEMBLIES & COMPLEXES
  description: >
    Many metabolic enzymes performing essential cellular roles function as homo-oligomeric assemblies, or in concert with other partner proteins in the cell. Therefore studying enzymes in the context of their higher order complexes is key to understanding functions.
    We adopt novel approaches in recombinant co-expression and endogenous isolation of metabolic complexes, for structural, biochemical and biophysical characterisation.

  name: INTEGRATIVE STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
  description: >
    We combine x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and complementary biophysical methods (including differential scanning fluorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, Michaelis-Mention kinetics) to study enzyme structures, dynamics and interactions. 
    We have to date determined > 200 structures, all deposited in the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/search?request=%7B%22query%22%3A%7B%22parameters%22%3A%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22audit_author.name%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22exact_match%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22Yue%2C%20W.W.%22%7D%2C%22type%22%3A%22terminal%22%2C%22service%22%3A%22text%22%2C%22node_id%22%3A0%7D%2C%22return_type%22%3A%22entry%22%2C%22request_options%22%3A%7B%22pager%22%3A%7B%22start%22%3A0%2C%22rows%22%3A25%7D%2C%22scoring_strategy%22%3A%22combined%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%5B%7B%22sort_by%22%3A%22score%22%2C%22direction%22%3A%22desc%22%7D%5D%7D%2C%22request_info%22%3A%7B%22src%22%3A%22ui%22%2C%22query_id%22%3A%22e700aff762bed0fd2ab01c15791d146a%22%7D%7D).
    Our goal is to provide insight into functional and disease-causing mechanisms.

  name: SMALL MOLECULE DRUG DISCOVERY
  description: >
    Disease-associated metabolic enzymes often lead to aberrant flux and accumulation of toxic metabolites. 
    Therefore, pathway manipulation to reduce flux to the defective enzyme could have therapeutic benefit. 
    Our objectives are to develop small molecule inhibitors for enzymes upstream of a metabolic defect, as 'substrate reduction therapy'.
    Check out our hit discovery projects of [GALK1](https://zenodo.org/record/4153570#.YNjxHLuSk2w), [HAO1](https://zenodo.org/record/4153603#.YNjxObuSk2w), [ALAS2](https://zenodo.org/record/4153550#.YNjxVbuSk2w) and [AASS](https://zenodo.org/record/4153536#.YNjxeLuSk2w) in the public domain.
