intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I currently hold a chair at the Newcastle University [Biosciences Institute](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/biosciences/) as Professor of Structural Biology. I lead a team of postdoc and graduate researchers in the [Yue lab](https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/yuelab/), integrated into the [Newcastle Structural Biology Laboratory](https://nsbl.ncl.ac.uk/blog/).
    My research focuses on a moleulcar understanding towards the cause and therapy for rare metabolic diseases, and aligns with the cross-cutting themes of [Molecular Mechanisms of Life](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/research-themes/biomolecules/) and [Discovery of Medicines](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/research-themes/therapeutics/) of the Faculty of Medical Sciences.
    
    
    Want to join us? We are recruiting 2 postdoc positions ([here](https://jobs.ncl.ac.uk/job/Newcastle-Research-Associate-in-Structure-Based-Drug-Design/711711601/) and [here](https://jobs.ncl.ac.uk/job/Newcastle-Research-Associate/711931801/)).
