intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I am currently a Professor of Structural Biology at the
    [Biosciences Institute](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/biosciences/) of Newcastle University. I lead a team of postdoc and graduate researchers, which is integrated into the [Newcastle Structural Biology Laboratory](https://nsbl.ncl.ac.uk/blog/).
    My research focuses on rare metabolic diseases, and falls into the cross-cutting themes of [Discovery of Medicines](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/research-themes/therapeutics/) and [Molecular Mechanisms of Life](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/research-themes/biomolecules/).
